    <p id="down">5 Major Types of Wine</p><br>
    
    <!--Red Wine Section-->
    <p class="header">~Red Wine~</p>
    <p class="info">Red wine is a type of wine made from dark-colored (black) grape varieties. The actual color of the wine can range from intense violet, 
    typical of young wines, through to brick red for mature wines and brown for older red wines. The juice from most purple grapes is greenish-white, 
    the red color coming from anthocyan pigments (also called anthocyanins) present in the skin of the grape; exceptions are the relatively uncommon 
    teinturier varieties, which produce a red-colored juice. Much of the red-wine production process therefore involves extraction of color and flavor 
    components from the grape skin. It is a delicacy around the world.</p><br>
    
    <!--White Wine Section-->
    <p class="header">~White Wine~</p>
    <p class="info">White wine is a wine that is fermented without skin contact. The colour can be straw-yellow, yellow-green, or yellow-gold. It is produced 
    by the alcoholic fermentation of the non-coloured pulp of grapes, which may have a skin of any colour. White wine has existed for at least 2500 years.<br><br>
    
    The wide variety of white wines comes from the large number of varieties, methods of winemaking, and ratios of residual sugar. White wine is mainly from 
    "white" grapes, which are green or yellow in colour, such as the Chardonnay, Sauvignon, and Riesling. Some white wine is also made from grapes with coloured 
    skin, provided that the obtained wort is not stained. Pinot noir, for example, is commonly used to produce champagne.<br><br>

    Among the many types of white wine, dry white wine is the most common. More or less aromatic and tangy, it is derived from the complete fermentation of the
    wort. Sweet wines, on the other hand, are produced by interrupting the fermentation before all the grape sugars are converted into alcohol; this is called 
    Mutage or fortification. The methods of enriching wort with sugar are multiple: on-ripening on the vine, passerillage (straining), or the use of noble rot. 
    Sparkling wines, which are mostly white, are wines where the carbon dioxide from the fermentation is kept dissolved in the wine and becomes gas when the 
    bottle is opened.<br><br>
    
    White wines are often used as an apéritif before a meal, with dessert, or as a refreshing drink between meals. White wines are often considered more
    refreshing, and lighter in both style and taste than the majority of their red wine counterparts. In addition, due to their acidity, aroma, and ability 
    to soften meat and deglaze cooking juices, white wines are often used in cooking.</p><br>
    
    <!--Rose Wine Section-->
    <p class="header">~Rose Wine~</p>
    <p class="info">A rose (from French rosé [ʁoze]), also labelled rosado in Portuguese and Spanish-speaking countries and rosato in Italy, is a type of 
    wine that incorporates some of the color from the grape skins, but not enough to qualify it as a red wine. It may be the oldest known type of wine, as 
    it is the most straightforward to make with the skin contact method. The pink color can range from a pale "onion-skin" orange to a vivid near-purple, 
    depending on the grape varieties used and winemaking techniques.<br><br>
    
    There are three major ways to produce rosé wine: skin contact, saignée, and blending. Rosé wines can be made still, semi-sparkling or sparkling and 
    with a wide range of sweetness levels from highly dry Provençal rosé to sweet White Zinfandels and blushes. Rosé wines are made from a wide variety 
    of grapes and can be found all around the globe.<br><br>
    
    When rose wine is the primary product, it is produced with the skin contact method. Black-skinned grapes are crushed and the skins are allowed to remain 
    in contact with the juice for a short period, typically two to twenty hours.[3] The must is then pressed, and the skins are discarded rather than left in 
    contact throughout fermentation (as with red wine making). The longer the skins are left in contact with the juice, the more intense the color of the final 
    wine.<br><br>
    
    When a winemaker desires to impart more tannin and color to red wine, some of the pink juice from the must can be removed at an early stage in what is 
    known as the Saignée (from French bleeding) method. The red wine remaining in the vats is intensified as a result of the bleeding, because the volume of 
    juice in the must is reduced, and the must involved in the maceration becomes more concentrated. The pink juice that is removed can be fermented separately 
    to produce rose.<br><br>
    
    The simple mixing of red wine into white wine to impart color is uncommon, and is discouraged in most wine growing regions, especially in France, where 
    it is forbidden by law, except for Champagne. Even in Champagne, several high-end producers do not use this method but rather the saignée method.</p><br>
    
    <!--Sparkling Wine Section-->
    <p class="header">~Sparkling Wine~</p>    
    <p class="info">Sparkling wine is a wine with significant levels of carbon dioxide in it, making it fizzy. While the phrase commonly refers to champagne, 
    EU countries legally reserve that term for products exclusively produced in the Champagne region of France. Sparkling wine is usually either white or rose, 
    but there are examples of red sparkling wines such as the Italian Brachetto, Bonarda and Lambrusco, Spanish wine Cava, Australian sparkling Shiraz, and 
    Azerbaijani "Pearl of Azerbaijan" made from Madrasa grapes. The sweetness of sparkling wine can range from very dry brut styles to sweeter doux varieties 
    (French for 'raw' and 'sweet', respectively).<br><br>
    
    The sparkling quality of these wines comes from its carbon dioxide content and may be the result of natural fermentation, either in a bottle, as with 
    the traditional method, in a large tank designed to withstand the pressures involved (as in the Charmat process), or as a result of simple carbon dioxide 
    injection in some cheaper sparkling wines.<br><br>
    
    In EU countries, the word "champagne" is reserved by law only for sparkling wine from the Champagne region of France. The French terms Mousseux and 
    Crémant refer to sparkling wine not made in the Champagne region, such as Blanquette de Limoux produced in Southern France. Sparkling wines are 
    produced around the world, and are often referred to by their local name or region, such as Espumante from Portugal, Cava from Catalonia, Prosecco, 
    Franciacorta, Trento DOC, Oltrepò Pavese Metodo Classico and Asti from Italy (the generic Italian term for sparkling wine being spumante), and Cap 
    Classique from South Africa. Sparkling wines have been produced in Central and Eastern Europe since the early 19th-century. "Champagne" was further 
    popularised in the region, late in the century, when József Törley started production in Hungary using French methods, learned as an apprentice in Reims. 
    Törley has since become one of the largest European producers of sparkling wine. The United States is a significant producer of sparkling wine today, 
    with producers in numerous states. Recently, production of sparkling wine has re-started in the United Kingdom after a long hiatus.</p><br>

    <!--Fortified Wine Section-->
    <p class="header">~Fortified Wine~</p>        
    <p class="info">Fortified wine is a wine to which a distilled spirit, usually brandy, is added.[1] Many different styles of fortified wine have been 
    developed, including Port, Sherry, Madeira, Marsala, Commandaria wine, and the aromatised wine Vermouth.</p>
